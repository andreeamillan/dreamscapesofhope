            <h1> Princess Tutu </h1>
                <p> Princess Tutu, created by Ikuko Itoh in 2002, follows Nanae Kato, also known as Duck, in her journey being a ballet dancer who also transforms into a duck. This show heavily focuses on the romance aspect of the genre as the main goal of the protagonist is to help restore a prince's heart. Princess Tutu shows its uniqueness by having a love triangle throughout the series and combining classical music pieces with it's animated choreography. Duck having 3 forms that she's consistently switching between also creates unique challenges and scenarios. She not only adjusts to improving her skills but navigating the world with her transformations that she can't control. </p>
        
        <h1> Impact </h1>
             <p> This series captivated audiences by having a unique approach to a magical girl transformation. Themes of perfectionism and insecurity in one's craft can be observed with how the characters dance to transform. The ambition that goes into wanting to be a prima ballerina can make anyone who is passionate about a specific skill or talent relate to the need for perfection. Having a smaller audience than other shows, it also serves as nostalgia for the animes produced during the 2000s. </p>
    
        <h1> Quotes </h1>
            <p> “May those who follow their fate be granted happiness; may those who defy it be granted glory”
