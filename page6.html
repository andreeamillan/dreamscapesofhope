            <h1> Miraculous Ladybug </h1>
                <p> Created by Thomas Astruc in 2015, Miraculous Ladybug follows two protagonists who navigate maintaining their secret identities and personal lives. Heroes Ladybug and Chat Noir fight to protect Paris from akumatized villains, vulnerable people who are taken advantage of by the main villain when showing a negative emotion. While being a show centered around a duo, Ladybug's personal and superhero life shows how confidence and security can change a person. Ladybug also encourages former villains to change from their mistakes and find other ways to cope with strong and painful emotions. The show covers many famous landmarks in Paris and utilizes magical talismen known as Miraculous to be given to different holders. </p>

            <p> "Do you realize how many fears you've managed to overcome? The objects that help you get over your fears are just like the Miraculous and you fight everyday to defend a cause without anyone noticing. That's just like having a secret identity."
                "Ladybug saved Paris from destruction once again, but who's gonna save Marinette from her homework?"
