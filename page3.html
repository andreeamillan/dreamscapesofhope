            <h1> Madoka Magica </h1>
                <p> Madoka Magica, created by Gen Urobuchi in 2011, shows us an interesting and dark side of magical girls. With the short series starting off appearing like a typical magical girl show, darker themes are explored as the series continues. Grief, violence, and despair can be observed when the Magica Quartet goes against greater evils. The protagonists must come together and fight witches while exploring truths about the fear and harm that plagues the world. The challenges that come with being a hero ultimately make this series a psychological thriller and magical girl show at the same time. </p>
        
        <h1> Impact </h1>
             <p> The release of this show impacted audiences greatly. The plot twists and despair shown throughout the series captured audiences and provided commentary on themes like mental illness, the loss of innocence, and growing older. Additionally, the two main protagonists have an unrequited and implied love story that gives even more insight into the sadder themes of the show. This kind of expansion to the genre highlights how mentally taxing saving the world would be and how much risk would be involved. There's no doubt that this darker exploration of magical girls left a lasting impact on audiences. </p>
