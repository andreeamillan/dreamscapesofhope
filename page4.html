            <h1> Kiki's Delivery Service </h1>
                <p> Kiki's Delivery Service, released in 1989 by Studio Ghibli, is a story about a young witch named Kiki exploring and living in a new town alone to begin her witches training. It deals with more realistic problems like adjusting to a new place, attaining a first job, and feeling homesick. Kiki feeling more confident as the film progresses is a reminder of the good that can come from stepping outside your comfort zone. </p>
        
        <h1> Impact </h1>
             <p> Coming from such a beloved studio and director, audiences were sure to love this film. Audiences can find comfort in watching Kiki maintain independence on her own and learn the challenges that come with navigating the world. It takes an encouraging approach to living and exploring a new place alone, and drives the idea that you should choose the path and journey that feels right for you. </p>
    
        <h1> Quotes </h1>
            <p> “They might be different, but humans are so quick to decide that anything they don't understand is evil.”
                "“I’ve come to believe that everyone has some type of magic inside them. If a person can find their magic and lovingly cultivate it, they’ll truly feel alive every day. There is magic inside each and every one of you, too— I believe that.”</p>
