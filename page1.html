        <h1> Quotes </h1>
            <p> "The people of the world, all of them... tend to think only about what we cannot share. But our brains are all the same. We are the same people."
                "We all, everyone one of us, carry a star inside our chests. ...Light and darkness are always side-by-side. If you show even the slightest fear or tears to the darkness, it will immediately swell and come attacking, and swallow up the light. Serenity, in order to defeat the darkness and dark souls, you must keep the star inside your chest burning brightly at all times. That is your most important charge."
                /
                “Even though we’re both girls, I think it must have been fate. It must have been our destinies to join together."
