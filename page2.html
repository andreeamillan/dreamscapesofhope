            <h1> Winx Club </h1>
                <p> Winx Club, created by Italian animator Iginio Straffi in 2004, is an example of how differently artists interpret magical girl elements. The Winx Club powers involve elements, with the main goal of its heroines being to learn about magic and protecting the universe. The female protagonists are all fairies, and their designs are a prime example of 2000s cartoons. The main protagonist, Bloom, is shown throughout the series gaining more confidence in herself and her powers. </p>
        
        <h1> Impact </h1>
             <p> In terms of aesthetics and a development of the genre, Winx Club no doubt played a role in shaping it's young audience. Viewers feel they can relate to the protagonists with each heroine/hero having a multitude of powers and interests. The protagonist having a coming of age story additionally helps viewers relate and find comfort in the show. The design of the series also has had a huge lasting impact. From Halloween costumes to pastel color palettes and fairy wings, people still talk about the series because of it's unique style choices. </p>
    
        <h1> Quotes  </h1>

                "I don't think the planet is really dead - it just needs help."
